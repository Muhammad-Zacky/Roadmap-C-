# Roadmap-C-
The Jurney:
1st Week: Now, these seven days will introduce you to something that you have no previous knowledge of. So make sure you understand the foundations well and give a kickstart to the world of programming.

What is C++?
It’s history and features.
Understanding and writing our first Hello World program in C++.
Tokens
Variables, Datatypes.
Keywords
How to take input from the user?
Operators
Arithmetic Operators.
Logical Operators.
Relational Operators.
Other operators.
Selection Statements
if statements
if-else
else-if
switch
2nd Week: Now you have understood the basic units of a program well. Its time to take a step forward. So, schedule yourself to learn the following topics.

Loops
for loop
while loop
do-while loop
Jump Statements
goto
break
continue
Comments.
Arrays
One-Dimensional Array.
Two-Dimensional Array.
Strings.
Now, start solving some problems on these topics, so that you get a good grip on them.

3rd Week: It’s time to start functions and play with pointers.

Functions
Call by value.
Call by reference
Function Overloading.
Inline functions.
Pointers: Now this is a topic that most of the students find difficult. But believe me, it’s a myth. If you will understand the basics of pointers well, you will surely love C++, as it is one of C++’s coolest features. So get a hold on them.
Relation between Pointers and Array.
Array to Functions.
Structures.
As I said, solve problems to check your understanding.

4th Week: Now, these topics are asked everywhere like Interviews, practical exams, etc. So don’t make haste and understand them in depth.

Classes and Objects.
this keyword, static keyword, Friend Functions.
Constructors.
Default Constructor.
Parametrized Constructor.
Copy Constructor.
Destructors.
Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming(OOP).
Abstraction.
Encapsulation.
Inheritance.
Polymorphism.
Data Hiding.
Practice problems on these concepts.

5th Week:

Inheritance
Types of Inheritance.
Derived and Base class.
Access Specifiers.
Polymorphism.
Compile Time Polymorphism.
Overloading.
Overriding.
Run Time Polymorphism.
Virtual Functions.
Operator Overloading.
Exception Handling.
Practice, practice, and practice.

6th Week: Get familiar with:

Templates.
Data File Handling.
Macros.
